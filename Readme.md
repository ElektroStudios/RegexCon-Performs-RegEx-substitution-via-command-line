# RegexCon

### Command-line app to perform Regular Expression (RegEx) string substitutions.

![logo](/Images/logo.png)

------------------

## üëã Introduction

I decided to develop **RegexCon** as a solution for a third-party application that is written in a scripting language with limited Regex capabilities, but that third-party application supports running external apps, and this is where **RegexCon** comes into play for me, bridging the gap by enabling that third-party application to execute regular expression substitutions as required.

**RegexCon** could be used, for example, in a for-loop of any programming language to perform file renamings.

I'm convinced you would find additional scenarios where this tool proves invaluable to you!.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Limitations

**RegexCon** relies on the .NET regex engine and it utilizes its pattern syntax. While most common regex pattern syntax from other languages will work properly with **RegexCon**, it's important to note that each programming language has its own regex implementations, which may include minor syntax differences and/or limitations. For instance, a named group in PHP is written differently than in .NET. The responsibility for syntax adaptation lies with the end user.

## üìù Requirements

- Microsoft Windows OS.
